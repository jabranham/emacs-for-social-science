;;; init.el --- This is a basic emacs configuration aimed at social scientists using R/latex/markdown/git

;;; Commentary:
;; init.el is the first file that Emacs reads when it starts up. We
;; don't do much here, but we do tell it to load another file
;; "init-emacs.org", which is where we do most of our configuration.

;; A description on how to use this file and the corresponding org
;; file is given in the README document, which you should have
;; received along with this file. If not, you may find it on github:
;; https://github.com/jabranham/emacs-for-social-science


;;; Code:

(if (version< emacs-version "24.5.1"); Minimum version is emacs 24.5.1
    (error "Your Emacs is too old -- this config requires v%s or higher"))
(package-initialize)
(require 'org)
(org-babel-load-file (concat user-emacs-directory "init-emacs.org"))

;;; init.el ends here
